<h2>Getting to Chengcheng</h2>
<p>Chengcheng is the county city of Weinan County in China's Shaanxi Province. Although there now exists a high speed rail line connecting Chengcheng with Xi'an, during my two visits we hired a taxi for the three hour drive through rural China to get to Chengcheng. It was striking how much the landscape changed on the way to the county city. Upon leaving the sprawling metropolis of Xi'an, we soon found ourselves driving through rural farm areas surrounded by tiny villages. The journey was a truly special experience in and of itself.</p>

<h2>Our Hotel in the County City</h2>
<p>On both visit, we stayed in the main hotel in Chengcheng. Although it was the largest, and catered mainly to business travelers, the check-in process was slow and filled with bureaucracy. Chengcheng receives western visitors so seldom that the local hotels don't have a system to enter passport and visit information, thus necessitating a visit from the local police department.</p>
<p>Everyone was incredibly friendly, and the local law enforcement even posed for photos with us during their visit to the hotel to verify our passport and visa info. The rooms were clean, but in need of renovation. They also smelled of stale cigarette smoke. Aside from this, the staff was incredibly kind and welcoming, and the breakfast buffet was well thought-out and presented in a charming atmosphere. It was hard to find anything to dislike about the experience.</p>
